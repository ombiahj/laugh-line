# Laugh Line

Laugh Line is a capstone project. It uses a public API (JokeAPI) to display either a single joke or a two-part joke with a punchline.

## Running 

Install the required node.js modules:
Use npm run dev / node index or you can install nodemon to run index


- npm install
- npm run dev - trigers the script in package.json ("dev": "node --watch index") and runs the server like nodemon would. server will run and changes will not require a server restart.
